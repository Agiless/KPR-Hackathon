## ❓ Why We Built Aura

If you’ve ever been lost in a mall trying to find a store, struggled to locate parking, or panicked when you couldn’t find your family in a crowd — you know the frustration.

Malls are exciting, but they can also be overwhelming. **Aura exists to make that experience effortless and safe.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Aura is an **all-in-one mall assistant** that:

* Answers shopper queries with **AI-powered chat**.
* Finds products just by **snapping a photo**.
* Offers **3D indoor navigation** so you’ll never be lost again.
* Provides **community safety features (SOS alerts)**.
* Helps retailers **increase visibility and engagement**.

---

## ✨ What Aura Can Do

✔ Conversational AI – Chat with Aura for directions, store info, and promotions.
✔ Visual Product Search – Upload a product image to find matches inside the mall.
✔ 3D Indoor Navigation – Interactive map with shortest-path guidance.
✔ Parking & Service Finder – Check live availability.
✔ SOS Safety System – Trigger alerts in case of emergencies.
✔ Feature Image Rendering – If you buy a shirt, Aura suggests matching accessories, pants, or related products.
✔ Credit System (Aura Coins) – Users earn coins by leaving genuine reviews (based on majority sentiment). These coins can be redeemed for discounts, offers, or even selected products.
